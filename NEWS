NEWS file for Stjerm <http://code.google.com/p/stjerm-terminal-emulator/>

0.15 (<insert date>)
  * Stjerm now needs at least GTK version 2.22 and VTE 0.26 to build
  * WIP: Stjerm is now built using the sleek and enigmatic cmake! This will make
    it easier to create packages and new libraries, features and files without 
    having to deal with the dreaded "autohell".
  * Removed '-v' as an option for version information. This is to better conform 
    to the GNU standards where '-v' is used for verbose output. '--version' 
    remains unaffected.
  * Sadly, I'm going to discontinue making xz archives for the source packages,
    at least until CMake adds support for it.

0.14 (2011-01-30)
  * New feature: You can now set whether you want an audible bell enabled for
    the terminal though the .Xdefaults and runtime arguments bell and -bell, 
    respectively.  The default value is TRUE.  See the man page for more info.
  * Fixed a bug where the command line argument for setting the amount of
    scrollback lines was set to '-bl' instead of '-l'. 
  * Changed '--v' to '-v' for version info since a '--' is used for a long 
    version of a command, not a short version.  '--version' is still there and
    remains unchaged.
  * Stjerm's source code is now released as both a bzip2 and xz compressed 
    tarball.  Both contain the same source code, however the xz tarball is
    slightly smaller in size.
  * The man page and --help runtime argument have had slight updates to them.

0.13 (2009-06-24):
  * Man page has been rewritten making it cleaner and more concise
  * --help and --info options have been alphabetized making it easier to read
  * Removed version.m4 as it was superfluous (The version number is updated in 
    cofigure.ac)
  * An RPM is now available for Fedora 11 users!

0.12 (2009-03-06):
  * Added copy and paste keyboard shortcuts 'c' and 'v', respectively
  * Keyboard shortcuts to switch to the previous and next tab have been 
    re-mapped to page up and page down, respectively
  * Added version information output through --version and --v
  * Tabs now loop when the end or beginning of the tab bar is reached
  * Many files and functions have been updated to conform to GNU standards (Such 
    as README and print_version)
  * Added NEWS and TODO
  * Version information is now updated through version.m4
