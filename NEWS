NEWS file for Stjerm <http://code.google.com/p/stjerm-terminal-emulator/>

0.14 (2011-01-30)
  * New feature: You can now set whether you want an audible bell enabled for
    the terminal though the .Xdefaults and runtime arguments bell and -bell, 
    respectively.  The default value is TRUE.  See the man page for more info.
  * Fixed a bug where the command line argument for setting the amount of
    scrollback lines was set to '-bl' instead of '-l'. 
  * Changed '--v' to '-v' for version info since a '--' is used for a long 
    version of a command, not a short version.  '--version' is still there and
    remains unchaged.
  * Stjerm's source code is now released as both a bzip2 and xz compressed 
    tarball.  Both contain the same source code, however the xz tarball is
    slightly smaller in size.
  * The man page and --help runtime argument have had slight updates to them.

0.13 (2009-06-24):
  * Man page has been rewritten making it cleaner and more concise
  * --help and --info options have been alphabetized making it easier to read
  * Removed version.m4 as it was superfluous (The version number is updated in 
    cofigure.ac)
  * An RPM is now available for Fedora 11 users!

0.12 (2009-03-06):
  * Added copy and paste keyboard shortcuts 'c' and 'v', respectively
  * Keyboard shortcuts to switch to the previous and next tab have been 
    re-mapped to page up and page down, respectively
  * Added version information output through --version and --v
  * Tabs now loop when the end or beginning of the tab bar is reached
  * Many files and functions have been updated to conform to GNU standards (Such 
    as README and print_version)
  * Added NEWS and TODO
  * Version information is now updated through version.m4
