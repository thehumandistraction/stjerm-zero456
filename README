Stjerm is a GTK+-based drop-down terminal emulator similar to the consoles used
PC games such as Quake and Half-Life 2.  Stjerm sets itself apart from
other-like programs by providing a minimalistic interface combined with a small 
file size, lightweight memory usage and easy integration with composite window
managers, such as Compiz.

Information about the current version of Stjerm (including new features and 
changes) can be found in the file NEWS.

For building and installation instructions, please see the file INSTALL.

Dependencies for building:  
  * pkg-config
  * GTK+ 2
  * VTE

The two subdirectories, 'src' and 'doc', contain the source code files and
